Maybe the honorable Supreme Court has recognized that the Comelec has very little time left [in its ongoing preparations for the 2025 midterm elections],\" Garcia said.</p><p>Garcia also said they have nothing to fear because everything that the Comelec did was aboveboard and in compliance with existing laws, including the Government Procurement Reform Act.</p><p>He said a restraining order from the Supreme Court would not stop the Comelec from automating the 2025 national and local elections.</p><p>\"We have to automate the national and local elections whatever the disposition of the Supreme Court because we cannot resort to manual election. Otherwise, the Comelec will be in violation of the law,\" he said. \"We can only resort to automated election in 2025 because that is what the law provides.\"</p><p>In November 2023, the Comelec en banc issued an order disqualifying Smartmatic Philippines from participating in all of its bids and election-related procurement.</p><p>The decision cited a questionable procurement from Smartmatic during the 2016 elections when the Comelec was headed by Juan Andres Bautista.</p><p>\"It is noteworthy that Bautista, who served as the chairman of the commission, was formally charged in September 2023, in connection with allegations of receiving bribes in exchange for awarding a contract for election machines to Smartmatic Corp.,\" the 17-page en banc resolution read.</p><p>It added: \"Bautista and others are alleged to have laundered the bribe money through multiple entities. It was revealed that Bautsita established a foreign shell company, which was used to receive bribe payments from Smartmatic. The charges against Smartmatic and former chairman Bautista are of public knowledge and tend to cause speculation and distrust of the electoral process.\"</p><p>\"Given the gravity of allegations related to bribery and compromised procurement processes, as independently determined by foreign bodies, the commission recognizes the imminent threat to the strength and integrity of our democratic processes. In the light of these findings, the commission acknowledges the imminent peril to the integrity and robustness of our democratic institutions,\" it added.</p><p>Smartmatic denied the allegations against it, saying they were based on news reports and unofficial leaked documents from abroad that have yet to be verified.</p><p>\"It is foundational to any legal system, here in the Philippines or anywhere in the world, that investigations or indictments do not automatically amount to guilt, nor [do they] affirm one&#039;s innocence. That&#039;s what legal proceedings are for,\" Smartmatic said.</p><p>\"Pending the definitive conclusion of an investigation, punishing Smartmatic will not only be premature but inconsistent with Philippine law, including its procurement laws,\"| it said.</p><p>\"Smartmatic is a trusted technology provider in the Philippines that has worked with Comelec since 2008. Over the years, all legal suits and election protests had all been dismissed. And recounts conducted since the first national automated election in 2010 have affirmed the reliability of its count, down to the last vote. In the 2022 elections, the system provided to Comelec enjoyed an unparalleled 82 percent trust rating from the public,\" the statement read.</p><p>Smartmatic had won all the biddings of the Comelec since 2010 when it first bagged the election automation project.</p><p>During the 2010 bidding for the election automation project, Smartmatic and six other bidders were all initially disqualified by the Comelec-Special Bids and Awards Committee (SBAC)</p><p>All seven bidders filed motions for reconsideration, but only Smartmatic passed the SBAC&#039;s eligibility, technical and financial requirements.</p><p>In 2015, Smartmatic was also disqualified by the SBAC in the P2.503 billion contract for the supply and lease of 23,000 units of precinct-based optical mark reader (OMR) counting machines for failure to submit valid articles of incorporation and for failure of its demo unit to meet the system requirement.</p><p>The SBAC decision was reversed by the Comelec en banc, however.</p>"

    "description": "<p>NEARLY P157 billion in retirement benefits was released by the Social Security System (SSS) to 2.2 million members in 2023, making it the most availed benefit package of the agency.</p><p>SSS Vice President for Benefits Administration Division Joy Villacorta said in a statement that of the 4.7 million benefits disbursed to pensioners, members and their beneficiaries in 2023, nearly half, or 47 percent, received retirement benefits.</p><p>The P156.7 billion in retirement benefits to 2.2 million payees in 2023 is 10.7 percent higher than the P141.5 billion given to over 2 million payees in 2022.</p><p>Majority of these payees (87.46 percent of the total) are pensioners, Villacorta said.</p><p>\"Retirement benefit is a cash benefit being granted by SSS to a member who can no longer work due to old age. Members who paid at least 120 monthly contributions will get a lifetime monthly pension while those with less than 120 monthly contributions will receive a one-time lump sum amount,\" Villacorta said.</p><p>Meanwhile, she said that death benefits came in second with a total release of P70.1 billion to 1.4 million beneficiaries in 2023, slightly lower than the P70.2 billion to 1.3 million beneficiaries in 2022.</p><p>\"SSS grants cash benefits to beneficiaries of a deceased member. Deceased SSS members with 36 monthly contributions will entitle their beneficiaries to a monthly pension. In comparison, beneficiaries of those with less than 36 monthly contributions will get a one-time lump sum amount,\" she added.</p><p>Maternity benefits followed with a disbursement of P14.1 billion to 357,000 members in 2023, up by 9.6 percent from P12.9 billion in 2022.</p><p>Female members who have paid at least three monthly contributions in the last 12 months before the semester of childbirth, miscarriage or emergency termination of pregnancy can avail of the maternity benefit.</p><p>As provided in the Expanded Maternity Leave Law (EMLL), the SSS maternity benefit is paid to an eligible member at every instance of her pregnancy since March 2019.</p><p>Meanwhile, Villacorta said that disability benefits came in fourth, with P7.5 billion released to over 130,000 members last year, a 16.3 percent increase from the P6.4 billion released in 2022.</p><p>\"Members who become disabled either partially or totally can receive a monthly pension or lump sum amount under the disability benefit. Members who have paid at least 36 monthly contributions are qualified to get a monthly disability pension, while those with less than 36 monthly contributions will be granted a lump sum amount,\" she added.</p><p>Funeral benefits followed with P4.8 billion reimbursed to 211,000 payees, and sickness benefits with P3.2 billion provided to 376,000 members.</p><p>\"We grant funeral benefits to whoever paid the funeral expenses of the deceased member. Claimants of deceased members with 36 or more monthly contributions may receive a variable amount from P20,000 to P60,000 depending on the number and amount of contributions paid by the member,\" Villacorta said.</p><p>The funeral benefit arising from the death of a member who paid less than 36 monthly contributions is fixed at P12,000.</p><p>Villacorta said that sickness benefit is a daily cash allowance paid for the number of days a member cannot work due to sickness or injury.</p><p>\"Unemployment benefit was the least availed benefit in 2023 with a total disbursement of P914.1 million to 64,000 members, down by 4.9 percent from the P961.4 million released to 75,000 members in 2022. This is also a reflection of the continuing improvement in the labor market, with the unemployment rate reaching its lowest levels last year,\" she said.</p><p>In total, the SSS said that benefit payments in 2023 amounted to P257.4 billion, up by 6.9 percent from the P240.6 billion disbursed in 2022.</p>"

I, thus, urge our commanders and units in the AFP to exert all efforts to operationalize the CADC,\" Teodoro said.</p><p>Teodoro also called for greater exposure and mobility in areas where the government needs to have a significant presence, specifically in the WPS \"where we cannot tolerate violations of our territorial integrity by anyone.\"</p><p>Teodoro&#039;s statement came after Chinese President Xi Jinping called on its armed forces on Thursday to coordinate preparations for military conflicts at sea to secure Beijing&#039;s interest.</p><p>However, Xi did not mention the area of its maritime domain specifically.</p><p>But China has repeatedly asserted its massive claim — nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, including what Manila claims as the West Philippine Sea (WPS).</p><p>Earlier, Teodoro went to Batanes to witness the graduation of 126 Philippine Navy (PN) reservists who will form part of the initial deployment of forces in the country&#039;s northern frontier.</p><p>The Defense chief said the deployment of the PN reservists was a fundamental step in achieving a stronger force to protect Philippine sovereignty.</p><p>Teodoro, along with AFP Chief of Staff Gen.

    "description": "<p>THE Philippines must strengthen its maritime and air capabilities to defend and protect its territory from the threat of foreign invasion, an analyst said on Saturday.</p><p>De La Salle University professor Renato de Castro even suggested that the Marcos administration should now focus on external threats, particularly China&#039;s provocative actions toward the Philippines in the latter&#039;s waters.</p><p>\"The very essence of this, of course, is to develop our capability to protect our comprehensive power in our exclusive economic zone. Not just in the West Philippine Sea, not just in the South China Sea, but in the entirety of our territory,\" he said in a weekly forum in Quezon City.</p><p>\"Of course, this will entail a huge amount of money because, indeed, we literally have to start from scratch. But this is, of course, our effort to address what we call a quintessential security threat, which is, of course, China literally knocking on our door.\"</p><p>Professor Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, meanwhile, said the government must take an unconventional approach to defend the country&#039;s territory.</p><p>Batongbacal said the \"big\" challenge for the Marcos Jr. administration is that Philippine waters and maritime natural resources \"are being taken actively\" by China.</p><p>Agreeing with Batongbacal, de Castro added that the government must come up with \"comprehensive\" strategies and suggested unilateral exploration of the country&#039;s resources and developing the Armed Forces of the Philippines&#039; (AFP) tri-service composed of the Army, Air Force, and Navy units.</p><p>Given that China \"has the largest navy in the world,\" de Castro proposed amending the AFP Modernization Law to allow the military to acquire its warships from local manufacturers.</p><p>De Castro made the recommendation as he emphasized the need to improve the country&#039;s port facilities and shipbuilding industry.</p><p>\"You cannot develop a credible navy if we do not have a strong shipbuilding industry,\" he said. \"We have to get ready, and, of course, the first thing that we have to do is to understand the issue.\"</p><p>De Castro acknowledged that the current administration&#039;s response to China&#039;s recent actions is \"very rigorous,\" citing the efforts to heighten the Philippines&#039; presence in its maritime territory.</p><p>Batongbacal agreed with de Castro&#039;s statement, saying the country is \"leveling up\" since most of the AFP personnel from its three units are getting involved in addressing the external threats, specifically China&#039;s presence in Philippine waters.</p><p>\"The government is really taking our external defense challenges seriously because for a long time, for several decades, the past administrations seem to have absorbed the attention of defense in internal security operations,\" he said.</p><p>\"&#039;If they are not stopped there, surely in the future, they will intrude into our inter-island resources and water resources, so this is really necessary,\" Batongbacal added.</p><p>China, he said, is \"clearly violating international law and trying to force us to submit to it.\"</p><p>\"We are pursuing our interest. We are trying to defend our resources. We are asserting our rights and entitlements in accordance with international law,\" he added.</p><p>On Friday, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. announced that the AFP has adopted the new Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept to defend the Philippine territory, including its exclusive economic zone.</p><p>The defense concept would allow the Philippines to project its military power into areas that must be protected and preserved according to the country&#039;s Constitution.</p><p>The move comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping called for coordination of military strategy at sea and to prepare for potential maritime conflicts.</p><p><strong>Intergenerational struggle</strong></p><p>Former Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio said that the Philippines must prepare for a long struggle with China over the West Philippine Sea (WPS), noting that it could become an \"intergenerational\" struggle for Filipinos.</p><p>\"We have to prepare for a very long struggle. China has clarified that these waters are its national territory, which includes the high seas of the South China Sea. Of course, the high seas belong to mankind, but China is claiming all of that as its national territory,\" Carpio said during the \"BBC World Questions: Philippines\" program aired by the British Broadcasting Corp.&#039;s World Service Radio on Saturday.</p><p>Carpio was a member of the team of Philippine lawyers who challenged China&#039;s intrusion into the WPS before the United Nations.</p><p>He added that the Philippines has the backing of its allies that supported the 2016 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) ruling against China, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Australia.</p><p>Political analyst Richard Heydarian agreed with Carpio that the WPS issue had become an \"intergenerational issue,\" noting the Marcos Jr. administration was doing the right thing.</p><p>\"What the current administration is doing is the right course of action ... You cannot be friends with people who act like the enemy,\" Heydarian said.</p><p>Carpio, however, warned that China might use its nuclear power and formidable naval force to intimidate the Philippines into submission.</p><p>Rafaela David, president of the Akbayan Citizens Action Party, said that China&#039;s intrusion into the WPS has been affecting the livelihood of fisherfolks in the area.</p><p>\"It is not just what China is doing, but what we are expecting China to do, but it is about what we, ordinary citizens, can do to show China that Filipinos are not going to be bullied,\" David said.</p><p>She urged the public to support initiatives against China&#039;s bullying, such as the \"Atin To\" Coalition organized in December last year.</p><p>Heydarian said the WPS situation is a \"crucial moment\" in Philippine history and an opportunity for Filipinos to show heroism just like what they did during the Philippine Revolution and the Filipino-American War.</p><p>\"Let us not fall for strategic gaslighting. China is blaming us for standing up to bullying; that is unacceptable. There is risk, but that is a risk worth taking,\" she said.</p>"

(CNOOC) made an oilfield discovery with a volume of 100 million tons in the eastern South China Sea, the company announced on Friday.</p><p>The new reserve was found in the Kaiping South Oilfield, 300 kilometers off the coast of Guangdong province in the south of the country.</p><p>Through continued exploration, the proved in-place volume of the Kaiping South Oilfield reached 102 million tons of oil equivalent.</p><p>The exploratory well has been tested to produce an average of approximately 7,680 barrels of crude oil and 0.52 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.</p><p>\"Kaiping South Oilfield is China&#039;s first deep-water and deep-play oilfield with proven in-place volume [of] over a hundred million tons,\" Xu Changgui, deputy chief exploration officer of CNOOC, said.</p><p>\"The company remains committed to oil and gas resources exploration and development in the South China Sea, thereby continuously enhancing its energy supply capacity,\" Zhou Xinhuai, CEO and president of the company, said.</p><p>CNOOC aims to produce 700 to 720 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2024, with 69 percent coming from China and the remainder from overseas operations.</p><p>Kaiping is in the southwest of the Pearl River Delta and is known as the center of the hometown of overseas Chinese in the five counties under Jiangmen City, according to a Research Report on Investment Environment by Shanghai Deloitte Tax Ltd., which was commissioned by the People&#039;s Government of Kaiping and the Scientific and Commercial Affairs Bureau of Kaiping to conduct a study on its investment environment.</p><p>\"It is a beautiful place and is famous for its local watchtowers, ancient buildings and Chinese folk arts. Its significant cultural legacy, prosperous economy, and rich natural and cultural sightseeing resources have made it one of the top 100 cities in China. Kaiping boasts strong advantages and a promising outlook in terms of geographical location, economic foundation and living environment,\" according to the report.</p><p>The same report said Kaiping was located \"along the transport artery connecting the Pearl River Delta and southwest Guangdong and is an important hub that links western Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau.\"</p><p>\"Its sound transportation infrastructure system is closely connecting Kaiping with Shenzhen, Guangzhou, HK and Macau, forming a geographical circle in which local businessmen can reach everywhere in two hours and generating strong synergies between cities in terms of industrial development and facilities supporting the living environment,\" it said.</p><p>The discovery was announced amid an ongoing dispute in the region that includes the Philippines, which has repeatedly accused China of trespassing on its territory.</p><p>Earlier this week, China Coast Guard and Chinese Maritime Militia vessels harassed, blocked, deployed water cannons and executed dangerous maneuvers to obstruct a routine Philippine rotation and resupply (RORE) mission to BRP Sierra Madre, deliberately grounded off Ayungin Shoal.</p><p>China accused the Philippines of \"violating\" an agreement during the RORE mission, which the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) vehemently denied, noting that no agreement exists in terms of the country&#039;s sovereignty over the West Philippine Sea (WPS).</p><p>The incident resulted in the collision between Philippine and Chinese vessels, causing injury to four Filipino security forces and damage to one of the country&#039;s boats.</p><p>On Friday, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. announced that the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has adopted the new Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept to defend the Philippine territory, including its exclusive economic zone (EEZ).</p><p>The defense concept would allow the Philippines to project its military power into areas that must be protected and preserved according to the country&#039;s Constitution.</p><p>The move comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping called for coordination of military strategy at sea and to prepare for potential maritime conflicts.</p><p><strong>Who stands to lose more</strong></p><p>Meanwhile, Professor Jay Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said China stood to lose more if it imposed economic sanctions on the Philippines.</p><p>It is actually Beijing that benefits more from its trade ties with Manila, Batongbacal asserted at the Saturday News Forum in Quezon City, considering that most of the consumers of its manufactured products are Filipinos.</p><p>\"That&#039;s easy to say, but let&#039;s see what the proof is. Is it true that our economy will collapse if China stops trading with us?\" Batongbacal asked in Filipino.</p><p>\"We have not yet seen any proof that China can actually sanction us economically,\" he said.</p><p>He recalled that China suffered grave repercussions when it imposed in the past trade restrictions on Australian goods.</p><p>In 2020, China blocked imports of Australian commodities, like coal, timber and barley, after Australia called for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19.</p><p>Batongbacal said the United States and Japan, serving as the Philippines&#039; largest trading partners, \"can easily fill in the trade gap with China.\"</p><p>Jollan Margaret Llaneza, foreign trade service officer at the Department of Trade and Industry, noted that the Philippines maintains a free trade agreement with China under the context of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations-China Free Trade Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.</p><p>She said the Philippines also benefits from the trade agreements because of lower tariff rates and a more liberalized market access for Filipino exporters.</p><p><strong>No major armed conflict</strong></p><p>Batongbacal also discounted the possibility of a major armed conflict between the Philippines and China, stressing that both countries have existing crisis management mechanisms that they must consider.</p><p>\"It&#039;s not that fast to have a war. It&#039;s not like it&#039;s just a child&#039;s game, like when something happens, there will be a war between two families,\" Batongbacal said still speaking in Filipino.</p><p>De La Salle University professor Renato de Castro said both countries should take into account the \"law of unintended consequences\" before considering waging a war.</p><p>De Castro added that they should learn from the lessons of the two-year Russia-Ukraine armed conflict, stressing that \"it&#039;s easy to start a war, but it&#039;s difficult to end it.\"</p><p>\"Once you start a war, you simply don&#039;t know what will happen,\" he said.</p>"
