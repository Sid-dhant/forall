PLDT was also declared \"solidarily liable\" with the contractors to pay the back monetary benefits of the contractors&#039; workers.</p><p>Then Secretary Silvestre Bello 3rd later ordered that 7,416 workers of the contractors that were declared as labor-only be considered as regular employees of PLDT from the time of their initial deployment and that they be included in the payroll of regular employees of the telecommunications company.</p><p>Bello also directed that the registration of the declared labor-only contractors be canceled.</p><p>In addition, contractors and PLDT were to pay the monetary benefits of the contractual employees amounting to P66,348,369.68.</p><p>Bello also declared that contractors who were able to show proof of compliance with Department Order (DO) 18-A implementing Articles 106 to 109 of the Labor Code were declared as legitimate contractors.</p><p>Contractors who were able to show sufficient proof of full or partial payment of the unpaid monetary benefits of their workers have their monetary liability either deleted or reduced, he said.</p><p>Bello subsequently issued another resolution reducing PLDT&#039;s and the contractors&#039; total monetary liability to P51,801,729.80. The number of regular employees was also reduced to 7,344.</p><p>On appeal, the CA upheld the jurisdiction of DoLE-National Capital Region Director and Bello to determine the existence of employer-employee relationship, which, according to the CA, is a condition sine qua non in the exercise of their visitorial and enforcement power.</p><p>The CA also agreed with Bello&#039;s ruling to prohibit PLDT from contracting out activities, services, jobs, or functions that are usually necessary and desirable in the usual course of its business.</p><p>The CA held that individuals deployed by contractors performing installation, repair, and maintenance services of PLDT lines should be considered regular employees of PLDT.</p><p>In affirming the ruling of the CA, the Court clarified that labor contracting is not per se illegal, following Article 106 of the Labor Code expressly allowing an employer to engage in legitimate labor contracting, which the DoLE implements through DO 18-A and DO 174-2017.</p><p>However, the Court found that the employees engaged in installation, repair, and maintenance services of PLDT lines are performing work directly related to the company&#039;s telecommunication business.</p>"

Rafael \"Raffy\" Tulfo, said that developing the country&#039;s natural gas industry would open up a larger market share for investors as government policy shifts towards clean energy.</p><p>SB 2247 authored by Tulfo seeks to promote the development of a comprehensive, and integrated legislative policy that aids in the rapid development of the Philippines&#039; natural gas sector.</p><p>The urgency of the bill&#039;s passage arises from the critical need to extend the life of Malampaya gas, which has provided about 40 percent of the country&#039;s natural energy needs since 2001.</p><p>The TWG also noted that the bill added a \"priority\" dispatch for indigenous natural gas to encourage more investments in the development of indigenous gas resources.</p><p>\"For consumers of fuel for gas-fired power plants, they prioritize their gas...We are not prioritizing blindly; we are prioritizing Filipino gas first. &#039;That is our policy because we believe that importation should not be the first step,\" said Tungol, who presided over the TWG meeting.</p><p>\"I think that is the best driver of our investment. Instead of them investing in importation, they should invest in facilities and infrastructure. This will generate jobs plus foreign investment,\" he added.</p><p>The Department of Energy (DoE) was present during the TWG meeting and expressed its support for the development of the country&#039;s natural gas industry, which also aims to promote growth in the power generation industry.</p><p>Tungol also said that using coal is \"a lot more ecologically damaging\" and more expensive than natural gas.</p><p>\"When you fire up a coal power plant, it is different from the light switch system, it takes a while to ramp up, to heat up, to generate energy. It also takes a while to adjust that energy, so if you change the energy demand, there are times that the production of coal is left behind, and we will have brownouts. Natural gas has faster transition, and we can easily act in case of shortage of power in a certain locality, as long as the grid is connected, we can immediately provide the excess electricity to the other side,\" he added in Filipino.</p><p>The TWG has yet to release the exact amount of reduction of prices once the law takes effect because pricing will depend on the market. However, Tungol assured that \"the end goal of all our energy bills is to drive down the [energy] prices.\"</p><p>\"What we can say is that it is not as volatile as coal. It does not explode, and it will not dip too low, it will only middle towards lower energy costs,\" Tungol said.</p><p>Aside from energy security, the TWG chairman noted that the development of the natural gas industry in the country has a \"trickle-down effect\" through the generation of jobs.</p>"

China surrounded the vast fishing atoll northwest of the Philippines with coast guard and suspected militia ships in 2012 after a tense standoff between Chinese and Philippine ships.</p><p>\"These are red lines for the Philippines, to the armed forces,\" Trinidad said at a news conference when asked what Chinese actions would be unacceptable to the Philippines in the disputed waters.</p><p>Trinidad said the administration of former president Rodrigo Duterte, who preceded current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., established those \"red lines,\" which delineate actions by China and any other rival claimant state that would spark fierce Philippine resistance in the disputed sea.</p><p>The latest flareup in the long-simmering disputes began when CCG and suspected militia ships shadowed, surrounded and blocked two Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) ships which were escorting two civilian motorboats manned by Filipino navy personnel.</p><p>They were on the way to deliver supplies and replacement navy and marine personnel to the BRP Sierra Madre, a navy warship that was deliberately grounded by the Philippine military in the late 1990s in the shallows of Ayungin Shoal to serve as a territorial outpost.</p><p>China also claims the area and has surrounded the shoal with coast guard, navy and suspected militia ships to prevent Filipino forces from delivering construction materials to reinforce the Sierra Madre, which is encrusted with rust and slightly tilting but remains an actively commissioned navy ship, meaning any attack on it would be considered by Manila as an act of war.</p><p>After dawn on Tuesday, a CCG vessel sideswiped one of the PCG ships, the BRP Sindangan, where crewmen scrambled to lower rubber fenders along the side to avoid damage to the hull. Two Associated Press journalists and other media who were invited to travel on the patrol ship witnessed the tense confrontation.</p><p>Inviting journalists to join trips by Philippine ships to the area is part of a strategy adopted last year by the government to publicize China&#039;s aggressive actions in one of the world&#039;s most hotly contested waterways.</p><p>China has reacted by providing its coast guard personnel with video cameras to contest Manila&#039;s version of the confrontations.</p><p>The CCG said in its account of the incident that the BRP Sindangan had rammed its ship, although the journalists aboard the PCG vessel saw the Chinese ship approach dangerously close before the collision.</p><p>Later, another CCG ship blocked and then collided with a supply boat being escorted by the PCG, Filipino officials said.</p><p>The supply boat was later hit by water cannon blasts from two CCG ships. Carlos was aboard the boat and witnessed the water cannon assault, which he said caused minor injuries to four navy personnel.</p><p>\"The pressure was really intense,\" Carlos said. \"It shattered the windshield of the boat and caused some injuries.\"</p><p>The damaged boat immediately returned to Palawan. The other supply boat managed to evade the CCG blockade and delivered supplies to the Filipino forces guarding the shoal, Philippine officials said.</p><p>The two-decade-long territorial standoff sparked a series of confrontations between Chinese and Filipino forces last year, with the Philippines protesting dangerous maneuvers by CCG vessels and China demanding that the Sierra Madre be towed away by the Philippines.</p><p>The CCG said in a statement that \"it took control measures in accordance with the law against Philippine ships that illegally intruded into the waters adjacent to Ren&#039;ai Reef,\" the name Beijing uses for Second Thomas Shoal.</p><p>Washington condemned the CCG actions, and its ambassador in Manila, MaryKay Carlson, said the US stands with the Philippines. Australia and Japan separately expressed their concern over China&#039;s actions.</p><p>In Washington, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the incidents demonstrated China&#039;s \"reckless disregard for the safety of Filipinos and also for international law,\" and that China was interfering with lawful Philippine maritime operations. The confrontations have sparked fears of a larger conflict that could involve the United States.</p><p>But China urged the Philippines to \"refrain from allowing itself to be manipulated by the US\" and warned that \"a pawn will only end up being abandoned.\"</p><p>China&#039;s Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning issued the statement following the latest encounter between PCG ships and Chinese vessels in the WPS. Four Filipino crew members were injured and their ship was damaged by water cannons from one of the Chinese vessels that tried to block the entry of boats that were bringing supplies to troops in the grounded BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal.</p><p>\"The Philippines also needs to refrain from being manipulated by the US. Lessons from history tell us that a pawn will only end up being abandoned,\" said Mao Ning during her regular press conference on Wednesday, March 6.</p><p><strong>Daily presence</strong></p><p>Amid the increasing challenges in Southeast Asia, particularly in the South China Sea, the US has vowed to maintain a daily US presence in the region as part of its security commitment to its friends and allies in the region.</p><p>US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink on Thursday, March 7, said the US presence will be more visible in the coming days in Southeast Asia to help Asean partners maintain stability, peace, and order in the region.</p><p>\"We will be flying and sailing around the region,\" the US official said during a digital press briefing attended by The Manila Times and other journalists from Asia and the US.</p><p>Earlier, Matthew Miller, spokesman of the US Department of State, said the provocative actions by China demonstrated disregard for the safety of Filipinos and international law.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) praised the Philippines for having \"consistently complied\" with the Arbitral Award on the South China Sea.</p><p>\"The arbitral award is final and legally binding on the parties to the dispute under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos), and Japan strongly hopes that the parties&#039; compliance with the award will lead to the peaceful settlement of disputes in the South China Sea,\" it said in a statement dated March 6.</p><p>Japan, it said, has consistently advocated upholding the rule of law at sea, and would continue to cooperate with the international community such as Asean member states and the United States to protect the free and open international order in the region.</p><p>In a separate statement, the embassies of Korea, France and Canada also conveyed their concern over the March 5 Ayungin incident and called for peaceful resolution of disputes.</p>"

They may also apply for new franchises but as part of transport cooperatives.</p><p>In its petition, Bayyo argued that the DoTr order is an invalid delegation of legislative power and is unconstitutional because it violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution.</p><p>But the high tribunal did not rule on these points, and said instead that the petition must be denied because the petitioners did not have the legal standing to file the case.</p><p>The decision written by Associate Justice Maria Filomena Singh was promulgated in July 2023, but made public only Thursday.</p><p>Singh noted that Bayyo failed to establish who its members are and that it had been duly authorized by said members to institute the petition.</p><p>Bayyo failed to submit any proof to support its claim that it is a legitimate association of PUJ operators and drivers, the Supreme Court said.</p><p>While Bayyo attached a certificate of registration issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), this merely proves its registration as an association but does not establish that its members are indeed PUJ operators and drivers, the high court said.</p><p>In the absence of Bayyo&#039;s articles of incorporation and by-laws or any other competent proof, the Supreme Court said it could not ascertain Bayyo&#039;s legal standing as an association of PUJ operators and drivers.</p><p>The petition also violated the principle of hierarchy of courts, which requires that a petition must first be brought before the lowest court with jurisdiction and then appealed until it reaches the high tribunal. This concurrent jurisdiction does not give the party discretion on where to file a petition, as noncompliance with this requirement is a ground for dismissal, the decision stated.</p><p>Under this doctrine, the Supreme Court is allowed only to resolve questions of law, notwithstanding the invocation of paramount or transcendental importance of the action.</p><p>While there are exceptions to the rule, the high court said the petitioners were unable to justify deviation from the doctrine as the issues they raised are not purely legal.</p><p>The Supreme Court ruled that the determination of whether DO 2017-011 is confiscatory, anti-poor, and deprives PUJ operators and drivers of their source of livelihood; of the purported financial impact of the modernization program on PUJ operators and drivers, including, among others, the cost of modernizing jeepneys, the loans and debts that will be obtained by PUJ operators and drivers to purchase the units; and of the alleged losses in the daily income that will be sustained by the PUJ operators and drivers as a result of the implementation of DO 2017-011, are all factual questions which entail the reception and evaluation of evidence.</p>"

A kind of hotline between us, so that if there is a message that needs to be sent from one president to another, we can be assured that that message will reach them,\" he said.</p><p>Asked if he has established that direct line with the Chinese leader more than a year since his last visit to China, Marcos said, \"Not yet, I&#039;m afraid.\"</p><p>Marcos reiterated that the Philippine government, under his watch, will not cease in defending the country&#039;s sovereignty.</p><p>\"Our sovereignty is sacred.

If we shift the activity to a civilian activity and China stops the resupply, then we can go to the tribunal again,\" Carpio said at the Kapihan sa Manila Hotel.</p><p>He added that the lighthouse and the maritime research center should be operated by the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), a civilian organization.</p><p>Rotation and resupply (RoRe) missions are a routine task to sustain military forces deployed in the West Philippine Sea and maintain a Philippine presence in its exclusive economic zone.</p><p>But Carpio said the Armed Forces of the Philippines&#039; (AFP) efforts to resupply the BRP Sierra Madre constitutes a military activity that is outside the scope of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) and compulsory arbitration, based on the arbitral award of July 12, 2016.</p><p>The Philippines has filed over 200 diplomatic complaints since 2017, following the continuous harassment by the Chinese in Ayungin Shoal.</p><p>The AFP reported that the China Coast Guard and Chinese maritime militia vessels have harassed, blocked, deployed water cannons and executed dangerous maneuvers in an attempt to stop the resupply missions.</p><p>\"The dangerous maneuvers conducted by China Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels violate the International rules on the Safety of Life at Sea. That&#039;s very clear. But the problem is, where do we go to complain?\" Carpio said.</p><p>He suggested the government deploy more Coast Guard vessels to accompany and protect the resupply ships or to conduct international joint patrols with the United States and other states if China does not stop blocking the Philippine vessels.</p><p>He said the US or other countries that join the Philippines in joint patrols will not violate any laws as Ayungin Shoal is part of the country&#039;s exclusive economic zone.</p><p>The pro-Beijing think tank Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute led by Herman Tiu Laurel said Carpio&#039;s comments at the Kapihan sa Manila Bay \"proves once and for all that Malacañang, the Department of Defense, Department of Foreign Affairs and the PCG are all wrong in saying their basis for the RoRe missions to Ayungin Shoal is Unclos.\"</p><p>In other developments, a US maritime expert said nearly a dozen ships belonging to China&#039;s People&#039;s Armed Forces Maritime Militia have returned to Escoda (Sabina) Shoal in the West Philippine Sea, which is within the Philippines&#039; exclusive economic zone.</p><p>Retired US Air Force Col.

    "description": "<p>A LAWMAKER on Wednesday called for an audit of the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) to find out what became of the P10.3 billion earmarked for the free tuition and living allowances of thousands of poor students enrolled in state universities and colleges (SUCs) and in private higher educational institutions.</p><p>In calling for an audit, Northern Samar Rep. Paul Daza was reacting to complaints by the Association of Higher Education Institution (AHEI) in Region 12 against CHEd for the non-payment of student scholarships under the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education or UniFAST, which is mandated to ensure that all eligible Filipinos get access to adequate and equitable education.</p><p>The P10.3 billion is part of the Higher Education Development Fund (HEDF) allocated to the CHEd, which comes from the earnings of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC), and travel taxes.</p><p>\"Those are earmarked funds by law and cannot be used outside of their specified purpose,\" Daza told The Manila Times, adding that if the said amount is not used, it would just stay idle at the National Treasury.</p><p>At the same time, Daza called on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to order a review of CHEd&#039;s performance pertaining to education standards, enrollment and graduation and dropout rates.</p><p>\"I am really disappointed with CHEd. The President probably should order an internal review of the CHEd&#039;s performance,\" he said, noting the reported dropout rate of 30 percent to 40 percent a year.</p><p>\"You have P10 billion, but you don&#039;t use it. I suspect there is a hidden agenda. That should be reviewed and investigated by the Commission on Audit and Malacañang,\" Daza said.</p><p>The Manila Times tried but failed to get a comment from CHEd.</p><p>Under the UniFAST program, scholars are to be provided P30,000 per semester for tuition and living allowances. CHEd is supposed to remit the funding to the SUCs or local universities and colleges or private HEIs.</p><p>Agapito Lubaton, AHEI president and chief executive officer of the Marvelous College in Koronadal City, said CHEd&#039;s total unpaid dues for school year 2021-2023 amount to P2.1 billion.</p><p>They also complained that just recently, CHEd suddenly changed the guidelines so that fewer scholars were qualified for school year 2022-2023.</p><p>\"Many schools suffer because while waiting for payment, students still attend school without paying their school fees,\" Lubaton said, adding that in his school, out of 1,800 aspiring grantees, only 36 qualified as scholars because of the new guidelines.</p><p>At a hearing conducted last year by the House Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Higher and Technical Education, CHEd Chairman Prospero de Vera 3rd said they have no funds to pay schools.</p><p>But on Aug.14, 2023, Rep. Mark Go directed the CHEd to pay all its scholarship debts to students and told it to use the P10.3 billion fund earmarked for this purpose.</p><p>CHEd was given a week to comply from the date of the hearing in August 2023. The Department of Budget and Management was also instructed to act on it immediately.</p><p>On Sept. 22, 2023, CHEd made a partial payment covering a third of tuition but has not covered the allowances yet.</p>"

    "description": "<p><em><strong>Last of two parts</strong></em></p><p>IMPOSING consistent regulation is challenging, given the frequent intervention of the courts, which can sometimes take years to render a judgment. A recent case involving an electric distributor in Pampanga is just one example.</p><p>In March 2023, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) ordered the San Fernando Electric Light and Power Co. Inc. (Sfelapco), which serves the capital of Pampanga and the nearby towns of Floridablanca and Bacolor, to pay a P21.6 million penalty and refund P654 million to its customers for disallowed and excess charges from 2014 to 2022. Sfelapco filed a motion for reconsideration that the ERC ejected on June 1, 2023. The company was also ordered to pay an additional P1.76 billion in refunds to customers.</p><figure class=\"image\"><!--rss article_body_images-->\n    <img src=\"https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2024/03/06/312451.jpg\" alt=\"Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman and CEO Monalisa Dimalanta. Photo by Mike Alquinto\"  onerror=\"this.style.display='none';\"\n         style=\"max-width: ;width: 100%;height: auto;object-fit: cover;\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>But Sfelapco appealed the ERC ruling to the Court of Appeals, which in a Nov. 30, 2023, decision reversed the ERC&#039;s refund order. In its decision, made public in January 2024, the CA said the order was disallowed \"due to lack of legal and factual basis,\" and that the ERC \"violated Sfelapco&#039;s right to due process when it ruled on the case.\" The basic assertion of the court was that while ERC was correct in determining that Sfelapco had imposed unauthorized charges on its customers, there was no specific provision in the law requiring a refund.</p><p>The CA&#039;s ruling appears illogical. After all, if one is convicted of theft, he does not get to keep the stolen property.</p><p>ERC Chairman Monalisa Dimalanta agreed with this view and said the ERC would appeal the CA ruling, with the help of the Office of the Solicitor General. Despite problems like this, however, she said the courts do have an important role to play.</p><p>\"The ERC is a quasi-judicial body, so our decisions are subject to review by the courts,\" Dimalanta said. \"I have no problem with that, it is a good thing. If we have made the right decision, having the confirmation from the court helps; likewise, if we have made a mistake — although we work very hard not to make mistakes, of course — then we need to know about it so we can make improvements.\"</p><p>The obstacle the court system poses to regulation is more of a management problem, in Dimalanta&#039;s view, and it is one that fortunately may be resolved in the coming years. \"The oversight by the courts is not the problem; the problem is that it is such a slow process,\" Dimalanta said. \"Some cases can take up to 10 years before there is a ruling. One of the reasons for that is simply because these cases are often very technical and require a lot of research on the court&#039;s part,\" because not every judge can be expected to be well-versed in the intricacies of utility regulation.</p><p>The Supreme Court is reportedly considering expanding the special court system to provide more efficient coverage of highly technical cases, such as cases involving the ERC. While this is not likely to be carried out overnight, such courts would help to reduce the uncertainty created by unresolved legal questions.</p><p><strong>Expanding consumer choice</strong></p><p>Dimalanta highlighted the expansion of the Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA) program, which designates large consumers as \"contestable customers,\" and allows them to choose their electricity supplier. A complementary program, the Green Energy Option Program (GEOP) also allows contestable customers to dictate that all or part of their supply come from renewable sources.</p><p>The RCOA program is being expanded in two ways. First, the threshold at which one can become a contestable customer has been lowered to 500 kWh per month. Second, with the completion of the Mindanao-Visayas interconnection, the RCOA program can be extended to Mindanao. That will happen later this year. Dimalanta said there was a slight delay, but only because the consumption threshold was being reviewed to determine if 500 kWh would give Mindanao customers the same level of choice as the rest of the country, or would need to be adjusted.</p>"

    "description": "<p>MANILA, Philippines: Northern Samar Rep. Paul Daza on Wednesday sought an audit on the P10.3 billion fund earmarked for the free tuition and living allowance of thousands of poor tertiary level students enrolled in state universities and colleges (SUCs) and in private higher educational institutions (HEIs).</p><p>Daza was reacting to complaints by the Association of Higher Education Institution (AHEI) in Region 12, against the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) for non-payment of student scholarship under the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education or UniFAST, which is in charge of implementing Republic Act 10931 to ensures that all eligible Filipinos get access to adequate and equitable education.</p><p>The P10.3 billion is part of the Higher Education Development Fund (HEDF) allocated to the CHED, The fund came from the earnings of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor), Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) and travel tax.</p><p>\"Those are earmarked funds by law and cannot be used outside of its specified purpose,\" Daza told <em>The Manila Times</em>, adding that if the amount is not used it would just stay idle at the National Treasury.</p><p>At the same time, Daza called on President Ferdinand Matrcos Jr. to order a review of the performance of CHEd pertaining to education standard, enrolment and graduation rates and drop rates, among others.</p><p>\"I am really disappointed with CHEd. The President probably should order an internal review of the CHEd&#039;s performance, the attrition rate, drop out rate of Filipino students,\" Daza said as he expressed dismay on reports that dropout rate is from 30 to 40 percent a year, which means only 60 students would be able to graduate out of the 100 enrolled.</p><p>\"You have P10 billion but you don&#039;t use it, I suspect there is a hidden agenda, That should be reviewed and investigated by the Commission on Audit and Malacanang,\" the lawmaker added.</p><p>Under the UniFAST program, scholars are to be provided P30,000 per semester for tuition fee and living allowance. CHEd is supposed to remit the funding to the SUCS or local universities and colleges (LUCS) and in the absence of SUCs and LUCs in some areas to private HEIs.</p><p>According to Agapito Libaton, AHEI president and chief executive officer of the Marvelous College in Koronadal City, CHEd&#039;s total unpaid dues for school year 2021-2023 amounted to P2.1 billion..</p><p>They also complained that just recently CHEd suddenly changed the guidelines that the DSWD&#039;s so called \"listahan 3.0\" would be used as basis, which resulted to the inclusion of only very few scholars for school year 2022-2023 up to the present because what was listed in the said list were the parents of the students.</p><p>\"Many schools suffer because while waiting for payment students still attend school without paying their school fees,\" added Lubaton, adding that in his school, out of 1,800 aspiring grantees only 36 were taken as scholars.because of the new guidelines.</p><p>\"There is no guidance from CHEd as to how poor but deserving students will be part of the DSWD listahan 3,0,\" he further said.</p><p>In a hearing last year by the House Committee on Appropriation and Committee on Higher and Technical Education Chairman Popy De Vera said they have no funds to pay schools.</p><p>But on Aug.14, 2023, Rep.. Mark Go directed the CHEd to pay all its scholarship debts to students, and was told to use the e P10.3 billion HEDF.</p><p>CHEd was given one week to comply from the date of the hearing of August 2023. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) was also instructed to act on it immediately.</p><p>On Sept. 22, 2023, CHEd paid in part the student fee of P10,000 but not the allowance, which has yet to be released.</p>"

That&#039;s why the ongoing attempt is always to try and lower the temperature down [when] the rhetoric is up,\" Marcos said in an interview with Australian journalist Sarah Ferguson on the sidelines of his participation in the Asean-Australia Special Summit in Melbourne earlier this week.</p><p>The chief executive noted that one way both countries can peacefully address the sea row is by establishing a direct line between Manila and Beijing where he and Xi can discuss issues at the highest level.</p><p>\"In fact, in January of last year, when I went to Beijing, and I visited with President Xi Jinping, that is what I proposed. A kind of hotline between us, so that if there is a message that needs to be sent from one president to another, we can be assured that that message will reach them,\" he said.</p><p>Asked if he has established that direct line with the Chinese leader more than a year since his last visit to China, Marcos said, \"Not yet, I&#039;m afraid,\" but was quick to reiterate that the Philippine government, under his watch, will not cease in defending the country&#039;s sovereignty.</p><p>\"Our sovereignty is sacred. We will not compromise it in any way. We are a sovereign nation. We will not allow a single square millimeter of our maritime rights to be trampled upon. The Philippines now finds itself on the frontline against actions that undermine regional peace, erode regional stability and threaten regional success,\" he said.</p><p>\"We don&#039;t see it as countering the military power of any country whatsoever. It&#039;s merely the defence of our territory. We have territorial conflicts with other countries, Malaysia for example and Vietnam but we&#039;ve come to an arrangement with them to resolve any such conflicts peacefully,\" he added.</p>"
